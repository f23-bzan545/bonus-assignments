Git -- Bonus assignment 2

Due by Tuesday, Sept 5 @ 11PM

Under each numbered prompt write the command(s)
you'd run in your bash shell to complete the prompt.

1. Clone your personal bonus repo (eg https://github.com/AdamSpannbauer/your-name-bonus-repo)
git clone https://github.com/AdamSpannbauer/your-name-bonus-repo.git

2. Clone the bonus-assignments repo: https://github.com/f23-bzan545/bonus-assignments
git clone https://github.com/f23-bzan545/bonus-assignments.git

3. Change directory into your bonus repo
cd your-name-bonus-repo

4. Create and switch to a new branch called bonus_2
git checkout -b bonus_2

5. Copy the bonus-assignment-02.txt from the bonus-assignments repo
   to a file called firstname-lastname-2.txt in your personal bonus repo
cp ../bonus-assignments/bonus-assignments/bouns-assignment-02.txt your-name-2.txt

6. Open firstname-lastname-2.txt to edit it 
   (and write in all your answers for 1-6)
nano your-name-2.txt
# type > CTRL+O > ENTER > CTRL+X

7. Commit your changes to branch bonus_2 with the commit message:
   "Answer questions 1 to 6"
git add your-name-2.txt
git commit -m 'Answer questions 1 to 6'

8. Get the status
git status

9. After writing the command in this file for step 8, commit again, 
   this time with commit message "Answer question 8"
git add your-name-2.txt
git commit -m 'Answer question 8'

10. Write the command to push bonus_2 to your repo, save this file, 
    then execute the actual push command that you wrote below, 
    then verify on GitHub whether all your changes are there,
    then do a pull request. 
    (the answer to this question is the push command)
# Run `git push` and copy code from that error output
git push --set-upstream origin bouns_2
