# When I say the second element, I mean the element with index 1
# When I say element two, I mean the element with index 2

# Question 1. consider the following list
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 45, 5, 3, 5, 6, 7, 77]
# Select the third element using a positive index

# Select the third element using a negative index

# Select the first 4 elements

# Select the last 4 elements

# Select the 5th and 7th item (result should be a list)

# Add the elements [5, 5, 9] to the end of `a`

# Question 4. Consider `a` and `b``. Run the following lines:
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
# Next, change `a` to [100, 2, 3] by *recreating* `a``.
# Then inspect the value of `a` and `b`.


# Did `b` change to `[100, 2, 3]`?

# Question 5. Consider a and b. Run the following lines:
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
# Next change `a` to [100, 2, 3] by *subsetting `a` and assigning 100 to the subset*.
# Then inspect the value of `a` and `b`.


# Did `b` change to `[100, 2, 3]`?
