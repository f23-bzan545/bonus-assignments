## Make a pip installable Python package

* **To submit, send me (aspannba@utk.edu) an email that contains**
  * 1 - A command to install your package from GitHub
    * e.g., this command will install a package from my Github:
      * `pip install git+https://github.com/AdamSpannbauer/minimal_python_package`
  * 2 - The name of a function I can run from your package
    * Your package must have at least 1 function or class in it
   
Example submission email for my package (you don't need the example usage but it'd save me a couple seconds):

> Install with: `pip install git+https://github.com/AdamSpannbauer/minimal_python_package`
> 
> Use the `rect_area` function:
> ```py
> import my_pkg
> my_pkg.rect_area(10, 30)
> ```

* **Package requirements**
  * Has at least one function or class
  * Include pandas as a dependency

Your package's functionality can be very very simple (ie a function that prints a word).  A resource I'm partial to: [github.com/AdamSpannbauer/minimal_python_package](https://github.com/AdamSpannbauer/minimal_python_package).
