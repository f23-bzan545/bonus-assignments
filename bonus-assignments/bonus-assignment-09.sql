-- 1. Create a table to hold this data in your database

-- 2. Load the data into the newly created table and report the number of rows

-- 3. Report on any cleaning you did outside of this file to make 2 work
--    If any cleaning is needed you can choose easy way out (ie remove problem rows)
--    If no cleaning needed leave blank and move on.

-- 4. Insert a new record into your table
--    use "BLAHBLAH" as the value for the state field;
--    make up the rest or reuse BLAH etc

-- 5. Write a SELECT query to prove your row is there

-- 6. Delete your new record from your TABLE

-- 7. Repeat your query from 5 to prove your row isn't there

-- 8. This is real data.  Do a little exploration.  Provide 1
--    SELECT query that provides some interesting tidbit.
--    The tidbit doesn't have to be mindblowing. If you're
--    stuck, start with grouping by something, aggregating something,
--    and sorting

-- 9. Provide a caption for your query/results from 8
