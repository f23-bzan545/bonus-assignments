## Make a web app using Python

Use dash, shiny, or some other *python* tooling to make a small app with visuals.  Don't copy/paste or retype someone else's app.

Submit the normal way of opening up a PR in your bonus repo and marking it for review.

* The app should have at least two different<sup>2</sup> types of inputs.
  * Different here means different modes of input. Two dropdowns is one type of input. Two dropdowns and a slider is two different types.
* The app should have at least two charts that are affected by the inputs.
* I should be able to run your app by using `python your_app_file.py` (esp if you use something besides dash or shiny) 

Use an old bonus assignment if you don't have ideas for data/charts ([05](https://github.com/f23-bzan545/bonus-assignments/blob/main/bonus-solutions/bonus-assignment-05.ipynb), [06](https://github.com/f23-bzan545/bonus-assignments/blob/main/bonus-solutions/bonus-assignment-06.ipynb), & [10](https://github.com/f23-bzan545/bonus-assignments/blob/main/bonus-solutions/bonus-assignment-10.ipynb) are ipynbs with potential data and viz).
