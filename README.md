## Why to

### Learning ig

These are to serve as practice of things seen in class.  Do your best to complete without ChatGPT.  If you use ChatGPT, make sure you're reviewing and understanding all of the answers you're putting.

### Grades

Each bonus assignment will be graded for accuracy.

* If your submission's accuracy is 70% or above -> you recieve full credit for the bonus
* If your submission's accuracy is below 70% (or not submitted) -> that bonus will be "exempt" for you

Each non-"exempt" bonus assignment will count as 1% of your grade

* If you have 20 non-"exempt" bonus assignments, then 20% of your grade will be bonus assignments. The remaining 80% will be accounted for by remaining grades as shown in syllabus.
* If you have 5 non-"exempt" bonus assignments, then 5% of your grade will be bonus assignments. The remaining 95% will be accounted for by remaining grades as shown in syllabus.
